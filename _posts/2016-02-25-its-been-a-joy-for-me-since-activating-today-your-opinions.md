Watch all of the videos you have access to once you activate -and watch 'em all the way through. This is different. The wait will be over soon, remember I told you that. When this thing launches live, it'll be 10 x better than it is right now, but you'll be the reason for that as a beta tester and founding member. As it stands in BETA the grid is really cool and creating a site like THEGRID.AI is so possible right now. Today. It's just nobody but the grid's done it so far. And it just loves #youtube/#vimeo, etc. vids with a passion. Be careful with how you title and describe your own and it will look pro all the time. Results and possibilities are going to surprise a lot of people as this A.I. child starts to grow up.﻿ Ok. That's my day 1 brainstorm report. Let's see how I'm feeling later on. So far so real good. The Grid does not suck."

Watch all of the videos you have access to once you activate and watch 'em all the way through. This is different. The wait will be over soon, remember I told you that, too.

As it stands in BETA the grid is coming along, it's really cool and creating a site like THEGRID.AI is very possible. And it just loves \#youtube/\#vimeo, etc. vids with a passion. Be careful with how you title and describe your own and they'll be treated with respect.
