            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>The Grid | AI Websites | Color System Overview</h1><p>Colorverse is The Grid's revolutionary algorithm that extracts colors from a photo, image, or logo and creates thousands of possible color palette combinations. Instead of painstakingly choosing individual colors for your design palette, you can upload a photo that has the color characteristics that resonate with your brand, and The Grid automatically constructs a color palette that fits perfectly with your site content.</p><img src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/the-grid-img/p/e9efbc363556bb311a97c1d6bce8bf7dd74431f9.jpg"></article>]]></description>

            <title><![CDATA[Surprises abound, thank god. There were so many people out there making me a nervous wreck by flat out lying about it being vaporware or like a new geo cities. False. Watch all of the videos you have access to once you activate -and watch 'em all the way through. This is different. The wait will be over soon, remember I told you that. When this thing launches live, it'll be 10 x better than it is right now, but you'll be the reason for that as a beta tester and founding member. As it stands in BETA the grid is really cool and creating a site like THEGRID.AI is so possible right now. Today. It's just nobody but the grid's done it so far. And it just loves #youtube/#vimeo, etc. vids with a passion. Be careful with how you title and describe your own and it will look pro all the time. Results and possibilities are going to surprise a lot of people as this A.I. child starts to grow up.﻿ Ok. That's my day 1 brainstorm report. Let's see how I'm feeling later on. So far so real good. The Grid does not suck. The question for me remains: is it even A.I. at all? I suppose we shall see.]]></title>
